 #Description

 With the rapid growth rate of human population, the food industry has been overwhelmed with increasing consumer demands.
 Over the recent decades, factory farming and transportation of food items became major factors in causing environmental concerns.

 Our team members are strong supporters of the Meat Free Mondays movement. We want to increase the awareness of environmental impacts of food production, and help encourage people to eat less meat, and more organically grown local produce.

 We created an app that will, on every Monday, remind you of #MFM movement. Send you real time twitter data and provide you with updated grocery prices, locations of vegan restaurants and delicious recipes to make your life healthier and more enjoyable.
